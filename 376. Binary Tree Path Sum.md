### Description
https://www.lintcode.com/problem/binary-tree-path-sum/ \
Given a binary tree, find all paths that sum of the nodes in the path equals to a given number target.\
A valid path is from root node to any of the leaf nodes.

### Example
Example 1:\
Input:\
{1,2,4,2,3}\
5\
Output: [[1, 2, 2],[1, 4]]\
Explanation:\
The tree is look like this:\
```
	     1
	    / \
	   2   4
	  / \
	 2   3
```
For sum = 5 , it is obviously 1 + 2 + 2 = 1 + 4 = 5

Example 2:\
Input:\
{1,2,4,2,3}\
3\
Output: []\
Explanation:\
The tree is look like this:\
```
	     1
	    / \
	   2   4
	  / \
	 2   3
```
Notice we need to find all paths from root node to leaf nodes.\
1 + 2 + 2 = 5, 1 + 2 + 3 = 6, 1 + 4 = 5 \
There is no one satisfying it.

### Code

        self.left, self.right = None, None

class Solution:
    # @param {TreeNode} root the root of binary tree
    # @param {int} target an integer

        # Write your code here

        return result

    def dfs(self, root, path, result, len, target):
        if root is None:
            return
        path.append(root.val)
        len += root.val

        if root.left is None and root.right is None and len == target:
            result.append(path[:])

        self.dfs(root.left, path, result, len, target)
        self.dfs(root.right, path, result, len, target)

        path.pop()
