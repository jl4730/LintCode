### Description
https://www.lintcode.com/problem/reverse-linked-list-ii/description
Reverse a linked list from position m to n.

Given m, n satisfy the following condition: 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ length of list.

Have you met this question in a real interview?  

### Example
Example 1:

Input: 1->2->3->4->5->NULL, m = 2 and n = 4, 
Output: 1->4->3->2->5->NULL.
Example 2:

Input: 1->2->3->4->NULL, m = 2 and n = 3, 
Output: 1->3->2->4->NULL.
Challenge
Reverse it in-place and in one-pass

### Code
```
from lintcode import ListNode


class Solution:

    def reverse(self, head):
        prev = None
        while head != None:
            next = head.next
            head.next = prev
            prev = head
            head = next
        return prev

    def findkth(self, head, k):
        for i in xrange(k):
            if head is None:
                return None
            head = head.next
        return head

    def reverseBetween(self, head, m, n):
        dummy = ListNode(-1, head)
        mth_prev = self.findkth(dummy, m - 1)
        mth = mth_prev.next
        nth = self.findkth(dummy, n)
        nth_next = nth.next
        nth.next = None

        self.reverse(mth)
        mth_prev.next = nth
        mth.next = nth_next
        return dummy.next
```
