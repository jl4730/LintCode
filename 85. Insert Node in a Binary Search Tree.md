### Description
https://www.lintcode.com/problem/insert-node-in-a-binary-search-tree/
Given a binary search tree and a new tree node, insert the node into the tree. You should keep the tree still be a valid binary search tree.

You can assume there is no duplicate values in this tree + node.

### Example
Example 1:
	Input:  tree = {}, node = 1
	Output:  1
	
	Explanation:
	Insert node 1 into the empty tree, so there is only one node on the tree.

Example 2:
	Input: tree = {2,1,4,3}, node = 6
	Output: {2,1,4,3,6}
	
	Explanation: 
	Like this:



	  2             2
	 / \           / \
	1   4   -->   1   4
	   /             / \ 
	  3             3   6
		
Challenge
Can you do it without recursion?

### Code
```

Definition of TreeNode:
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val):
        this.val = val
        this.left, this.right = None, None
"""
class Solution:
    """
    @param root: The root of the binary search tree.
    @param node: insert this node into the binary search tree.
    @return: The root of the new binary search tree.
    """
    def insertNode(self, root, node):
        if root is None:
            return node
            
        curt = root
        while curt != node:
            if node.val < curt.val:
                if curt.left is None:
                    curt.left = node
                curt = curt.left
            else:
                if curt.right is None:
                    curt.right = node
                curt = curt.right
        return root
