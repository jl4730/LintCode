### Description
https://www.lintcode.com/problem/shape-factory/
Factory is a design pattern in common usage. Implement a ShapeFactory that can generate correct shape.
You can assume that we have only three different shapes: Triangle, Square and Rectangle.

### Example
Example 1:

Input:\
ShapeFactory sf = new ShapeFactory();\
Shape shape = sf.getShape("Square");\
shape.draw();\
Output:\
```
  ----
 |    |
 |    |
  ----
```

Example 2:\
Input:\
ShapeFactory sf = new ShapeFactory();\
shape = sf.getShape("Triangle");\
shape.draw();\
Output:\
```
   /\
  /  \
 /____\
```
Example 3:\
Input:\
ShapeFactory sf = new ShapeFactory();\
shape = sf.getShape("Rectangle");\
shape.draw();\
Output:\
```
  ----
 |    |
  ----
```

### Code
```

"""
Your object will be instantiated and called as such:
sf = ShapeFactory()
shape = sf.getShape(shapeType)
shape.draw()
