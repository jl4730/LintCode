### Description
https://www.lintcode.com/problem/balanced-binary-tree/
Given a binary tree, determine if it is height-balanced.

For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differ by more than 1.

### Example
Example  1:
	Input: tree = {1,2,3}
	Output: true
	
	Explanation:
	This is a balanced binary tree.
		  1  
		 / \                
		2  3

	
Example  2:
	Input: tree = {3,9,20,#,#,15,7}
	Output: true
	
	Explanation:
	This is a balanced binary tree.
		  3  
		 / \                
		9  20                
		  /  \                
		 15   7 

	
Example  3:
	Input: tree = {1,#,2,3,4}
	Output: false
	
	Explanation:
	This is not a balanced tree. 
	The height of node 1's right sub-tree is 2 but left sub-tree is 0.
		  1  
		   \                
		   2                
		  /  \                
		 3   4
