### Description
https://www.lintcode.com/problem/two-sum/
Given an array of integers, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.

The function twoSum should return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target, where index1 must be less than index2. Please note that your returned answers (both index1 and index2) are zero-based.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution

### Example
Example1:
numbers=[2, 7, 11, 15], target=9
return [0, 1]
Example2:
numbers=[15, 2, 7, 11], target=9
return [1, 2]
Challenge
Either of the following solutions are acceptable:

O(n) Space, O(nlogn) Time
O(n) Space, O(n) Time

### Code
```
class Solution(object):
    def twoSum(self, nums, target):
        #hash用于建立数值到下标的映射
        hash = {}
        #循环nums数值，并添加映射
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if target - nums[i] in hash:
                return [hash[target - nums[i]], i]
            hash[nums[i]] = i
        #无解的情况
        return [-1, -1]
```
