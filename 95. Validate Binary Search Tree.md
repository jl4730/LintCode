Description
https://www.lintcode.com/problem/validate-binary-search-tree/
Given a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST).

Assume a BST is defined as follows:

The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.
A single node tree is a BST

Example
Example 1:

Input:  {-1}
Output：true
Explanation：
For the following binary tree（only one node）:
	      -1
This is a binary search tree.
Example 2:

Input:  {2,1,4,#,#,3,5}
Output: true
For the following binary tree:
	  2
	 / \
	1   4
	   / \
	  3   5
This is a binary search tree.
