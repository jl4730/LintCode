Description
https://www.lintcode.com/problem/tweaked-identical-binary-tree/
Check two given binary trees are identical or not. Assuming any number of tweaks are allowed. A tweak is defined as a swap of the children of one node in the tree.

There is no two nodes with the same value in the tree.

Have you met this question in a real interview?  
Example
Example 1:

Input:{1,2,3,4},{1,3,2,#,#,#,4}
Output:true
Explanation:
        1             1
       / \           / \
      2   3   and   3   2
     /                   \
    4                     4

are identical.
Example 2:

Input:{1,2,3,4},{1,3,2,4} 
Output:false
Explanation:

        1             1
       / \           / \
      2   3   and   3   2
     /             /
    4             4

are not identical.
