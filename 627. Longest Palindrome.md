### Description

https://www.lintcode.com/problem/longest-palindrome/
Given a string which consists of lowercase or uppercase letters, find the length of the longest palindromes that can be built with those letters.

This is case sensitive, for example "Aa" is not considered a palindrome here.

Assume the length of given string will not exceed 100000.


### Example
Example 1:\
Input : s = "abccccdd"\
Output : 7\
Explanation :\
One longest palindrome that can be built is "dccaccd", whose length is `7`.

### Code
```
class Solution:
    # @param {string} s a string which consists of lowercase or uppercase letters
    # @return {int} the length of the longest palindromes that can be built
    
    # the answer is the count of characters that has even number of appereances.
    # for characters that has odd number of appereances,
    # their appereances minus 1 will make their apperances even.
    # And finally we can put an unused character in the middle of the palindrome
    def longestPalindrome(self, s):
        # write your code here
        if not s:
            return 0
        
        _total = list(s)
        _odd = []
        _cut = 0
        
        for i in _total:
            if i in _odd:
                _odd.remove(i)
            else:
                _odd.append(i)
        
        if len(_odd) > 0:
            _cut = len(_odd) - 1
            
        return len(s) - _cut
            
```
