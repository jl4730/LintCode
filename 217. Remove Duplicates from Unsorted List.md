Write code to remove duplicates from an unsorted linked list.

Have you met this question in a real interview?  
Example
Example 1:

Input: 1->2->1->3->3->5->6->3->null
Output: 1->2->3->5->6->null
Example 2:

Input: 2->2->2->2->2->null
Output: 2->null
Challenge
(hard) How would you solve this problem if a temporary buffer is not allowed? In this case, you don't need to keep the order of nodes.
