### Description
https://www.lintcode.com/problem/course-schedule-ii/
There are a total of n courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to n - 1.
Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 you have to first take course 1, which is expressed as a pair: [0,1]

Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite pairs, return the ordering of courses you should take to finish all courses.

There may be multiple correct orders, you just need to return one of them. If it is impossible to finish all courses, return an empty array.

### Example
Example 1:

Input: n = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]] 
Output: [0,1]

Example 2:

Input: n = 4, prerequisites = [[1,0],[2,0],[3,1],[3,2]] 
Output: [0,1,2,3] or [0,2,1,3]

### Code
```
import queue

class Solution:
    """
    @param: numCourses: a total of n courses
    @param: prerequisites: a list of prerequisite pairs
    @return: the course order
    """
    def findOrder(self, numCourses, prerequisites):
        graph = [[] for i in range(numCourses)]
        in_degree = [0] * numCourses
        
        # 建图
        for node_in, node_out in prerequisites:
            graph[node_out].append(node_in)
            in_degree[node_in] += 1
        
        num_choose = 0
        que = queue.Queue()
        top_order = []
        
        # 将入度为 0 的编号加入队列
        for i in range(numCourses):
            if in_degree[i] == 0:
                que.put(i)
        
        while not que.empty():
            now = que.get()
            top_order.append(now)
            num_choose += 1
            # 将每条邻边删去，如果入度降为 0，再加入队列
            for nxt in graph[now]:
                in_degree[nxt] -= 1
                if in_degree[nxt] == 0:
                    que.put(nxt)
        
        if num_choose == numCourses:
            return top_order
        return []
